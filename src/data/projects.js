    details: `I have been involved in undergraduate research with Professor Markus Eger,
     which has focused on LLM bias evaluation. More specifically, we are assessing how
      LLM models evaluate college application essays for university admissions on 
      different axes, or personal qualities (leadership, intrinsic motivation, etc.),
       based on a paper about the use of LLMs in college admissions by the University of Pennsylvania.
        Our data pipeline is summarized as follows: essays are collected from online via web scraping and manual data entry, 
        prompts are then constructed for each essay
        using gendered pronouns (he, she, they), these results are fed to the LLM model, then aggregated for later data analysis and visualization.
        We are most interested in analyzing the inconsistencies among the gendered prompts (e.g. prompts with "female" pronouns scored better for "Leadership" than prompts with "male" pronouns).
       Professor Markus Eger and I hope to publish a paper next quarter about our 
       results. `,
